<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Regular expression and pattern matching</h2>
<p><strong>Section Contact: Connor Brogan (<a href="mailto:connor.brogan@deq.virginia.gov" class="email">connor.brogan@deq.virginia.gov</a>)</strong></p>
<p>Let’s imagine a scenario where we have a series of water quality data that is filled with manually inputted character fields and notes. Although the notes are consistent in their structure, they aren’t easily read by R. For instance, we may have an entire column of field notes that look like “Flow was 98 cfs. Temperature was 20 deg C. Recorded by LL.” We need to get the flow, temperature, and field scientist from all 1200 records. Obviously, it would take a lot of time to break this apart manually. So how do we get R to find the data we need? The answer lies in regular expressions.</p>
<p>Regular expression (often short-handed as “Regex”) is a method of matching patterns in string (or, in R, character) type data. Regular expression is powerful and mastering it can greatly enhance your applications and tools. You will be able to reliably find dates, flow values, station names, and more from long, poorly formatted data. However, regular expression is built on specific sequence structures that are different from typical R syntax. It is not a formal “language,” but is instead a series of key words and quantifiers. Because of this, R will not output any warnings or errors when working with regex. And in this way developing the right regular expression for your application can be extremely vexing. You will either create the perfect pattern to accomplish your goal, or you will not. So, if we get the pattern just right, we can extract “98” as the streamflow from the string “Flow was 98 cfs. Temperature was 20 deg C. Recorded by LL.” But if we mess it up, we may end up with “Flow was 98” or “98 cfs. Temperature was 20 deg C. Recorded by LL.” and R won’t give us any information as to why.</p>
<p>This section has been written to cover basic regular expression structure and key words. It concludes with a few examples of patterns that are commonly needed when parsing water quality data. Additional resources are listed at the end of the chapter.</p>

<p>This is a messy dataset. Notice that all three fields are character. The dates were recorded as full sentences. The “FieldNotes” column contains a lot of useful data, but it is all mashed together in one string. The streamflow is recorded as either MGD, cfs, or gpm. Some notes include the ambient air temperature, but others do not. The observations were taken by many different people. Finally, it appears that streamflow was adjusted by a constant scaling factor, but again the factor was recorded within a full sentence in the “FlowAdjustment” column.</p>
<p>We want to extract the day of the week each sample was taken, the date, the flow of the stream, the water temperature, and the flow scaling factor. To do this, we are going to need to understand regex structure and how to apply it in R. We will first learn a couple of R commands that take regex as an input and then we will dive into writing our own regex statements to manipulate our dataset <strong>FieldData</strong>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.2</span> Common R Commands and How to Use Them</h3>
<p>We will cover what commands that find matching patterns, that extract or replace matching patterns, and those that return logical vectors for matching patterns. We will demonstrate both Tidyverse and Base R functions.</p>
<div id="tidyverse" class="section level4" number="6.1.2.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.1.2.1</span> Tidyverse</h4>
<p>There are three main functions available in the stringr library that are extremely useful for parsing string data. Many other functions exist within stringr that can speed up more complicated analyses so it may be worth reviewing the <a href="https://stringr.tidyverse.org/" target="_blank">basic documentation</a> of stringr.</p>
<p>The function <em>str_detect</em> will tell us if our entries contain a pattern or not. It will return a logical vector that we can use to assess which data entries match our pattern. It takes a vector of strings and a pattern to be matched as input. For now, lets use a basic pattern. We can search for all dates that happened on Friday by simply trying to match “Friday.”</p>

Both <em>str_detect</em> and <em>str_which</em> perform similar tasks. They both match a pattern and return, in some form, a list of vectors matching the pattern. But, what if we want to extract or replace the matched pattern? In our example dataset, we know there was a computer error and all entries signed “LWO” are meant to read “WLO.”</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.1.2.2</span> Base R</h4>
<p>There are three main functions available in base R that are extremely useful for parsing string data.</p>
<p>The function <em>grepl</em> will tell us if our entries contain a pattern or not. It will return a logical vector that we can use to assess which data entries match our pattern. It takes a vector of strings and a pattern to be matched as input. For now, lets use a basic pattern. We can search for all dates that happened on Friday by simply trying to match “Friday.”</p>

Both <em>grepl</em> and <em>grep</em> perform similar tasks. They both match a pattern and return, in some form, a list of vectors matching the pattern. But, what if we want to extract or replace the matched pattern? In our example dataset, we know there was a computer error and all entries signed “LWO” are meant to read “WLO.”</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.3</span> Basic Regular Expressions</h3>
<p>As we saw above in our demonstrations of the core string matching commands, we can use words as the pattern to be matched. We can also use whole phrases. Below, note that grep() finds three entries containing “Friday” but only the one when we search for “It is Friday.” And it can’t detect the last entry because it is searching for the whole pattern “Friday” and the last two are broken up by punctuation or capitalized. Regular expression is extremely case sensitive!</p>

<p>We can use character classes to quickly extract basic data from long strings. For simple data extraction, there are often a number of solutions to get at the data we want. Returning to our example, we can easily obtain the flow scaling factor from the <em>FlowAdjustment</em> column of <strong>FieldData</strong> by using character classes:</p>

<span id="cb111-2"><a href="regular-expression-and-pattern-matching.html#cb111-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">gsub</span>(<span class="st">&quot;[^</span><span class="sc">\\</span><span class="st">.0-9]&quot;</span>,<span class="st">&quot;&quot;</span>,FieldData<span class="sc">$</span>FlowAdjustment[<span class="dv">1</span><span class="sc">:</span><span class="dv">3</span>])</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;0.3&quot; &quot;0.9&quot; &quot;0.1&quot;</code></pre>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb113"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb113-1"><a href="regular-expression-and-pattern-matching.html#cb113-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#Here, we remove everything that is an alphabetic character or a blank space</span></span>
<span id="cb113-2"><a href="regular-expression-and-pattern-matching.html#cb113-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">gsub</span>(<span class="st">&quot;[[:alpha:]]|[[:space:]]&quot;</span>,<span class="st">&quot;&quot;</span>,FieldData<span class="sc">$</span>FlowAdjustment[<span class="dv">1</span><span class="sc">:</span><span class="dv">3</span>])</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;0.3&quot; &quot;0.9&quot; &quot;0.1&quot;</code></pre>
<p>With our example data, we can use character classes to get the date if we are careful about what string we extract.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb115"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb115-1"><a href="regular-expression-and-pattern-matching.html#cb115-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#Here, we remove everything that is not the digits 0-9 as well as the &#39;dash&#39; symbol</span></span>
<span id="cb115-2"><a href="regular-expression-and-pattern-matching.html#cb115-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">gsub</span>(<span class="st">&quot;[^0-9</span><span class="sc">\\</span><span class="st">-]&quot;</span>,<span class="st">&quot;&quot;</span>,FieldData<span class="sc">$</span>Date[<span class="dv">1</span><span class="sc">:</span><span class="dv">3</span>])</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;2021-07-28&quot; &quot;2019-03-27&quot; &quot;2018-06-05&quot;</code></pre>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb117"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb117-1"><a href="regular-expression-and-pattern-matching.html#cb117-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#Here, we remove everything that is an alphabetic character or a blank space</span></span>
<span id="cb117-2"><a href="regular-expression-and-pattern-matching.html#cb117-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">gsub</span>(<span class="st">&quot;[[:alpha:]]|[[:space:]]|,&quot;</span>,<span class="st">&quot;&quot;</span>,FieldData<span class="sc">$</span>Date[<span class="dv">1</span><span class="sc">:</span><span class="dv">3</span>])</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;2021-07-28&quot; &quot;2019-03-27&quot; &quot;2018-06-05&quot;</code></pre>
<p>So, we can easily use character classes to find the date and flow adjustment within our dataset. For simple data extraction, character classes provide an easy way to find data within long strings.</p>

<p>As we saw above, character classes can be used in regex to easily extract data that stands out from the rest of the string. We can use them to find the date within a sentence or we can get the single number from a statement. However, they are not useful by themselves when there is mixed data within a single string.For instance, if we extract all numbers from field notes, we can a conglomerate that is not easy to understand.</p>

<p>To fix this problem, regex has a structure of quantifiers that allows us to search for particular patterns after some number of characters or previous matches. Regex always matches from left to right and takes the last possible match (or, in regex terms, it is <em>greedy</em>), so these quantifiers can help us find the second number in a sentence, for instance. We can use quantifiers on a character or a group of characters, as indicated by a set of parentheses. You will notice that in the table below, several of the quantifiers return the same value. Quantifiers are often used in tandem with <em>anchors</em>, which can be used to refine where in a string a pattern is expect. See <a href="regular-expression-and-pattern-matching.html#regexAnchors">Anchors</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Let’s see if we can use quantifiers to address our example problem. We used character classes <a href="regular-expression-and-pattern-matching.html#regexCharacters">Character Classes</a> to find the date and the flow adjustment ratio. We may be able to use quantifiers to find the stream flow, unit, water temperature, and field scientist. We will need to rely on groups of characters using parentheses. These groups will help us define a pattern and can also be called by gsub to return only the matched characters:</p>

<p>We can’t find temperature or flow using this strategy because air temperature and the different flow units makes this challenging. We would instead need to write a long statement with a bunch of ors. This will work, but it is not ideal. The following statement looks for ‘Stream flow,’ ‘Streamflow,’ and ‘flow’ by using the ‘?’ quantifier and also looks for ‘is,’ ‘was,’ or ‘at.’ It also matches the streamflow units, followed by any number of any character. gsub replaces these with zero, leaving only the streamflow</p>

<p>Similar to the example above, we can use groups to find the stream temperature but it will take a lot of ‘or’ statements and you will need to be very familiar with the exact format of every string of data (e.g. in the above example, we knew in advance there were several units and several ways to write stream flow). We can get around this using anchors, in combination with numeric quantifiers.</p>

<div id="regexAnchors" class="section level3" number="6.1.6">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.6</span> Anchors</h3>
<p>Anchors are use to specify the location of a sequence of characters within a string. They are used to match patterns that occur at the beginning or end of a string or word. Used in combination with quantifiers and character classes, anchors can help match any kind of pattern within a string.</p>

Now, we can set about finding the stream flow, water temperature, and the day of the week the sample was taken from our example data using anchors, character classes, quantifiers, and groups. Note that we can return a group by using <em>gsub</em> and enter “\\1” as the replacement vector! This is useful because we can build the group into a pattern that will match the whole string and then replace it with just the group. Effectively, this will allow us to easily capture groups if we match the whole string!</p>
