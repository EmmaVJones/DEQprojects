### GIS Rest Service Data

DEQ's GIS REST endpoints enable easy access to geospatial data for querying and analysis. For a primer on what these services offer and the basics of querying against these services, please see the [Consuming GIS REST Services in R](#consumingGISRESTservices) section. 

### Level Up Your Querying Game

The final example of [Consuming GIS REST Services in R](#consumingGISRESTservices) highlights how to use more complicated queries to limit data from within a single spatial layer. What about using information from one layer to limit the information provided on a second layer? 

![](../images/explodingHead.jpg)
Yeah, that's where we are going. 

But first, why would we want to do this? Besides using the GIS REST services to retrieve the most up to date version of spatial data, we also like to use these services to limit the amount of redundant data that we maintain on our local machines. Instead of, say, bringing back an entire polygon layer and a point layer, spatially intersecting them to find commonalities, and then doing something with said intersected data, we can go straight to the "doing something with intersected data" step by forcing the GIS REST service to perform our spatial operations. This reduces the amount of data we need to bring back to our machine initially, and reduces the number of associated files that we create during analysis steps. Win win.

### Set Up Your Environment

Load in the necessary packages.

```{r spatial operations REST libraries, eval=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(leaflet)
library(inlmisc)
library(geojsonsf)
library(dplyr)
library(urltools)
library(rgdal)
library(httr)
```

### Query One Layer

We will begin by querying the [Internal (Staff Only) REST Services](https://gis.deq.virginia.gov/arcgis/rest/services/staff){target="_blank"} by parsing a query of the TMDL records for a specific TMDL project in the Willis River Watershed identified as POL0119. After querying the data we will plot it using and interactive map built with inlmisc::CreateWebMap().

```{r spatial operations REST pull tmdl, eval=FALSE }
url <- parse_url("https://gis.deq.virginia.gov/arcgis/rest/services")
url$path <- paste(url$path, "staff/DEQInternalDataViewer/MapServer/72/query", sep = "/")
url$query <- list(where = "TMDL_EQ_ID = 'POL0119'",
                  outFields = "*",
                  returnGeometry = "true",
                  f = "geojson")
request <- build_url(url)

tmdl <- st_read(request)

CreateWebMap(maps = c("Topo","Imagery","Hydrography"), collapsed = TRUE) %>%
  addPolygons(data = tmdl, 
              color = 'black',
              fillColor = 'red', 
              fillOpacity = 0.6,
              stroke=5,
              label = ~WSHD_ID )
```

```{r spatial operations REST plot tmdl, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tmdl <- readRDS('../data/willisRiverTMDL.RDS')

CreateWebMap(maps = c("Topo","Imagery","Hydrography"), collapsed = TRUE) %>%
  addPolygons(data = tmdl, 
              color = 'black',
              fillColor = 'green', 
              fillOpacity = 0.6,
              stroke=5,
              label = ~WSHD_ID )
```

Once we have our chosen watershed, we want to identify monitoring stations within the watershed to investigate further. This could be done one of two ways. The first way, which is much less efficient, is to compare the TMDL watershed against all possible monitoring stations available via the REST service. This would require querying all monitoring stations, bringing that information into your local memory, and spatially intersecting the TMDL watershed against the many thousands of monitoring stations. That is not a great idea for this use case.

The preferred method is a two step process. Instead of querying all of the possible monitoring stations from the REST service, we could simply bring back stations that fall close by the TMDL watershed and then spatially intersect those against the watershed to find out which stations are actually within said watershed. That is a much better method as it only brings necessary data into your memory and is a much faster operation to perform on the REST service.

To identify the stations that fall close by the TMDL watershed, we can use a piece of information embedded in that watershed known as a bounding box. These are the coordinates of an area that encompasses our watershed. Let's extract this information from the watershed and look at the results.


```{r spatial operations REST extract bbox }
bBox <- st_bbox(tmdl) 
bBox
```

The bBox object contains the latitude and longitude values of the outermost extent of our TMDL watershed. To actually make this useful, let's convert it to an sfc object so we can plot it on a map with our TMDL watershed. For a good resource on simple feature objects, see this [article by Jesse Sadler](https://www.jessesadler.com/post/simple-feature-objects/){target="_blank"}.

```{r spatial operations REST plot bbox}
bBoxPolygon <- bBox %>%
  st_as_sfc()

CreateWebMap(maps = c("Topo","Imagery","Hydrography"), collapsed = TRUE) %>%
  addPolygons(data = tmdl, 
              color = 'black',
              fillColor = 'green', 
              fillOpacity = 0.6,
              stroke=5,
              label = ~WSHD_ID ) %>% 
    addPolygons(data=bBoxPolygon, weight=2, fill=FALSE, color="blue") 

```
### Query Layer Two Based On Information From Layer One

We can tell the GIS REST service to only retrieve monitoring stations within this bounding box (i.e. query a layer based on information from another layer) by adding this bounding box information into our query of the WQM Stations layer. This forces the REST service to perform the more computationally expensive step of only returning stations within our area. We are also going to add the XY coordinates to the object to make the mapping steps easier using st_coordinates(). 

```{r spatial operations REST query with bounding box, eval = FALSE}
# baseURL for  the WQM Stations layer
baseURL <- 'https://gis.deq.virginia.gov/arcgis/rest/services/staff/DEQInternalDataViewer/MapServer/104/query?'
# convert the bounding box from above to a character string to work in our query
bbox <- toString(bBox)
# encode for use within URL
bbox <- urltools::url_encode(bbox)
# EPSG code for coordinate reference system used by the TMDL polygon sf object
epsg <- st_crs(tmdl)$epsg

# set parameters for query
query <- urltools::param_set(baseURL,key="geometry", value=bbox) %>%
  param_set(key="inSR", value=epsg) %>%
  param_set(key="resultRecordCount", value=500) %>%
  param_set(key="f", value="geojson") %>%
  param_set(key="outFields", value="*")

# query the REST service
wqmstations_inbox <- geojson_sf(query) %>%
                                  dplyr::mutate(Longitude = sf::st_coordinates(.)[,1],
                                                Latitude = sf::st_coordinates(.)[,2]) %>% 
  dplyr::select(STATION_ID, Latitude, Longitude, everything())
# print out the data using DT::datatable()
datatable( wqmstations_inbox,  rownames = F,
          options = list(dom = 'lftip', pageLength = 5, scrollX = TRUE))
```

```{r spatial operations REST query with bounding box data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
wqmstations_inbox <- readRDS('../data/wqmstations_inbox.RDS') %>%
                                  dplyr::mutate(Longitude = sf::st_coordinates(.)[,1],
                                                Latitude = sf::st_coordinates(.)[,2]) %>% 
  dplyr::select(STATION_ID, Latitude, Longitude, everything())
datatable(wqmstations_inbox,  rownames = F,
          options = list(dom = 'lftip', pageLength = 5, scrollX = TRUE))
```

Let's plot these stations to make sure our query returned what we asked.

```{r spatial operations REST plot points with bounding box data}
CreateWebMap(maps = c("Topo","Imagery","Hydrography"), collapsed = TRUE) %>%
  addPolygons(data = tmdl, 
              color = 'black',
              fillColor = 'green', 
              fillOpacity = 0.6,
              stroke=5,
              label = ~WSHD_ID ) %>% 
  addPolygons(data=bBoxPolygon, weight=2, fill=FALSE, color="blue") %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(data = wqmstations_inbox, lng = ~Longitude, lat = ~Latitude, 
             label = ~as.character(STATION_ID)) 
  
```

That is still a lot of stations! This is a good example of why it is a best practice to have the database do as much data limiting for you as possible. 

### Spatially Intersect Layers

The final step of this workflow is to spatially intersect the monitoring stations within the watershed (i.e. find the points inside the polygon). We will do this with the st_intersection() function from the sf library. Once we intersect these layers, we will add the final point object to our map, colored in red, to verify the intersection only returned monitoring stations within the polygon. Like before, we will add the XY coordinates of these point to the object using st_coordinates() to enable easier plotting.

```{r spatial operations REST intersection layers point, eval = FALSE}
insideWatershed <- st_intersection(wqmstations_inbox, tmdl) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(Longitude = sf::st_coordinates(.)[,1],
                Latitude = sf::st_coordinates(.)[,2])

datatable(insideWatershed)
```

```{r spatial operations REST intersection EVJ, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# had to run this in R 4.1.2 to get the it to work
# EVJ method
# insidewatershed <- st_intersection(wqmstations_inbox,tmdl) %>%
#   dplyr::mutate(Longitude = sf::st_coordinates(.)[,1],
#                 Latitude = sf::st_coordinates(.)[,2])

insideWatershed <- readRDS('../data/insideWatershed.RDS')
```

```{r spatial operations REST intersection almost map}
CreateWebMap(maps = c("Topo","Imagery","Hydrography"), collapsed = TRUE) %>%
  addPolygons(data = tmdl, 
              color = 'black',
              fillColor = 'green', 
              fillOpacity = 0.6,
              stroke=5,
              label = ~WSHD_ID ) %>% 
  addPolygons(data=bBoxPolygon, weight=2, fill=FALSE, color="blue") %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(data = wqmstations_inbox, lng = ~Longitude, lat = ~Latitude, 
             label = ~as.character(STATION_ID)) %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(data = insideWatershed, lng = ~Longitude, lat = ~Latitude, 
                   color = 'red',
                   label = ~as.character(STATION_ID) )
```

Mission accomplished. If we look closely at our data we can see there are 149 rows of information in the point file, but only `r  length(unique(insideWatershed$STATION_ID))` unique monitoring stations to investigate for the rest of our analysis. The map indicates this with the "redder" sites, indicating there is overplotting of points. We can clean this up in subsequent data manipulation steps to make a publication quality map.


```{r spatial operations REST intersection final map, eval = F}
insideWatershedUniqueSites <- insideWatershed %>% 
  dplyr::select(STATION_ID, WQM_STA_DESC, everything()) %>% #rearrange columns
  distinct(STATION_ID, .keep_all = T) # keep only rows with unique STATION_ID information

CreateWebMap(maps = c("Topo","Imagery","Hydrography"), collapsed = TRUE) %>%
  addPolygons(data = tmdl, 
              color = 'black',
              fillColor = 'green', 
              fillOpacity = 0.6,
              stroke=5,
              label = ~WSHD_ID ) %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(data = insideWatershedUniqueSites, lng = ~Longitude, lat = ~Latitude, 
                   color = 'red',
                   label = ~as.character(STATION_ID) )
```


```{r spatial operations REST intersection final map EVJ, echo = F}
# 3.6.2 memory issues
insideWatershedUniqueSites <- readRDS('../data/insideWatershedUniqueSites.RDS')%>% 
  dplyr::select(STATION_ID, WQM_STA_DESC, everything()) 

CreateWebMap(maps = c("Topo","Imagery","Hydrography"), collapsed = TRUE) %>%
  addPolygons(data = tmdl, 
              color = 'black',
              fillColor = 'green', 
              fillOpacity = 0.6,
              stroke=5,
              label = ~WSHD_ID ) %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(data = insideWatershedUniqueSites, lng = ~Longitude, lat = ~Latitude, 
                   color = 'red',
                   label = ~as.character(STATION_ID) )
```
